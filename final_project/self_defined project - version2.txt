Idea:
Building Modeling Engine

Inspired by project2B, the engine will pre-determine some 3D and 2D model for user, including: 3D: cube, pyramids, sphere, 2D: square, line, window

User can either (1) Call function DrawCube(), DrawPyramids(), DrawSphere(), etc to draw a building or other shape by themselves 
OR (2) Call function: DrawBuilding(double width, double length, double height, int num_of_floor, int num_of_room). 
This function will draw a building for the user with the color they specified. 
Also, similar with all the Draw*() function at part(1), DrawBuilding(...) can cooperate with other Draw() function to create different shape. 

Other features: color function (reuse Brown(), LightBrown(), etc from project 2B and add more colors).

--------------------------------------------
Inspired by Auto-Speech Recognition of the Youtube, automatica adding the captions to the video is really helpful. Also, I see the shortcome of this is it only recognize the English rather than other language.
If there is the script of the subtitile that been able to translate to English, and write to the video, that's helpful the enlarge the range of audience.

Details:
The program will get the file that contain all the subtitiles and its time in the video.
Program would read the time and put the subtitle to the video in the indicated time clip.
The program may skip the speech recognition function, I will try to implement adding the caption with existing text first. Then, try to add the speech recognition if the time is allowed.
(* subtitles are writting in the text)
